How to Manage &amp; Distribute the Traffic through Auto Scaling Groups &amp; Load Balancers - ELB, ASG &amp; Route 53 Case Study

**Problem Statement:**

You work for XYZ Corporation that uses on premise solutions and a limited number of systems. With the increase in requests in their application, the load also increases. So, to handle the load the corporation has to buy more systems almost on a regular basis. Realizing the need to cut down the expenses on systems, they decided to move their infrastructure to AWS.

**Tasks to Be Performed:**

1. Manage the scaling requirements of the company by:
   
a. Deploying the multiple compute resources on the cloud as soon as the load increases and the CPU utilization exceeds 80%
b. Removing the resources when the CPU utilization goes under 60%

2. Create a load balancer to distribute the load between compute resources.
3. Route the traffic to the company domain.
